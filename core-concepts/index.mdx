elizaOS has three main concepts:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot" href="/core-concepts/agents">
    AI personalities that interact with users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plugins" icon="puzzle" href="/core-concepts/plugins">
    Extensions that add capabilities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Projects" icon="folder-tree" href="/core-concepts/projects">
    Collections of agents and plugins
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    User --> Agent
    Agent --> Plugins
    Plugins --> Actions[Actions/Providers/Evaluators]
    Actions --> Response
    Response --> User
```

## Quick Example

An agent using plugins:

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-discord",
    "@elizaos/plugin-twitter"
  ]
}
```

Plugins provide:
- **Actions** - Things agents can do (send messages, query data)
- **Providers** - Data sources (weather, time, knowledge)
- **Evaluators** - Response filters (safety, quality)
- **Services** - Background tasks (scheduled posts, monitoring)
