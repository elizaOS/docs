elizaOS is a vibrant ecosystem and community of builders. We support projects building on our platform. Whatever stage of development your application or project is in, we have systems designed to support your success. If you build on elizaOS, we WILL help you.

This page is pretty sparse right now, but we're actively adding more resources.

<Note>
**Stay Connected**: The best way to stay plugged in is through [Discord](https://discord.gg/ai16z). That's where you'll hear about new opportunities, connect with other builders, and get the most up-to-date info.

Below are the main resources we offer today. Apply to whatever makes sense for your project:
