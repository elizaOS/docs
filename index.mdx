## What is elizaOS?

elizaOS is a TypeScript framework for building AI agents that can think, learn, and act autonomously. Create agents with unique personalities, equip them with tools to interact with the world, and let them work toward their goals independently.

## Key Capabilities

elizaOS agents are more than chatbots. They're autonomous entities that can:

- **Define unique personalities and goals** through character files
- **Take actions in the real world** by equipping agents with plugins
- **Orchestrate multi-step workflows** through natural language conversations
- **Remember and learn** from interactions with persistent memory
- **Run anywhere** locally for development or deploy to production

## Plugin Ecosystem

The framework ships with 90+ official plugins spanning:

- **Social platforms** - Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and more
- **Blockchain networks** - Ethereum, Solana, Base, and other chains
- **AI providers** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, and local models
- **DeFi protocols** - Trading, lending, yield farming
- **Content creation** - Image generation, video, music
- **Data analysis** - Web scraping, API integrations, databases

The plugin architecture lets you mix and match capabilities without modifying core code. Your agents can trade onchain, manage social media accounts, create content, analyze data, or interact with any API, blockchain, website or repository.

## Design Philosophy

elizaOS is built on three core principles:

**1. Character-Driven**  
Agents aren't just code - they're entities with personalities, goals, and unique voices. Character files define who your agent is and what it wants to achieve.

**2. Action-Oriented**  
Agents don't just talk, they do. Through actions and evaluators, agents can interact with external systems, make decisions, and work toward their goals autonomously.

**3. Memory-Persistent**  
Every interaction shapes your agent. With built-in memory systems, agents remember conversations, learn from experiences, and build relationships over time.
