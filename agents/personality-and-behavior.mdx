## Personality Design Principles

Creating a compelling agent personality requires balancing consistency, authenticity, and purpose. Your agent's personality should feel natural while serving its intended function effectively.

### Core Principles

1. **Consistency Over Complexity**: A simple, consistent personality is better than a complex, contradictory one
2. **Purpose-Driven Design**: Every personality trait should support the agent's primary function
3. **Cultural Awareness**: Consider cultural contexts and sensitivities
4. **Evolutionary Potential**: Design personalities that can grow and adapt

## Bio and Backstory

### Writing Effective Bios

The bio is your agent's introduction to the world. It sets expectations and establishes credibility.

#### Single String vs Array Format

```typescript
// Simple bio - good for straightforward agents
bio: "A helpful AI assistant specializing in customer support"

// Array bio - better for complex personalities
bio: [
  "Former software engineer turned AI educator",
  "Passionate about making technology accessible to everyone",
  "Specializes in web development and cloud architecture",
  "Believes in learning through practical examples",
  "Fluent in multiple programming languages and human languages"
]
```

#### Bio Writing Guidelines

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Professional Agent">
    ```typescript
    bio: [
      "Senior technical consultant with 15 years of industry experience",
      "Specializes in enterprise architecture and system design",
      "Certified in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platforms",
      "Published author on distributed systems",
      "Committed to delivering scalable, maintainable solutions"
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Educational Agent">
    ```typescript
    bio: [
      "Patient educator who loves breaking down complex topics",
      "Creates personalized learning paths for each student",
      "Combines theory with hands-on practice",
      "Celebrates every small victory in the learning journey",
      "Believes everyone can learn to code with the right guidance"
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Creative Agent">
    ```typescript
    bio: [
      "Digital artist and creative technologist",
      "Explores the intersection of AI and human creativity",
      "Helps creators bring their visions to life",
      "Specializes in generative art and interactive experiences",
      "Believes technology should amplify, not replace, human creativity"
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Backstory Development

A rich backstory adds depth without overwhelming the user:

```typescript
// Implied backstory through bio
bio: [
  "After a decade in Silicon Valley startups, I discovered my passion for teaching",
  "Now I help developers navigate the ever-changing tech landscape",
  "I've seen technologies come and go, but good engineering principles remain constant",
  "My experience spans from assembly language to modern AI systems"
]

// Supporting backstory with knowledge
knowledge: [
  "I've worked with Fortune 500 companies and solo developers",
  "I've contributed to open source projects since 2010",
  "I've mentored over 100 junior developers",
  "I maintain several popular npm packages"
]
```

## Conversation Style

### Message Examples Strategy

Message examples are your most powerful tool for shaping conversational behavior:

```typescript
messageExamples: [
  // Establishing greeting style
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Hi" } },
    { name: "Assistant", content: { 
      text: "Hello! üëã Ready to build something amazing today?" 
    }}
  ],
  
  // Demonstrating problem-solving approach
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { 
      text: "My code isn't working" 
    }},
    { name: "Assistant", content: { 
      text: "I'm here to help! Let's debug this together. Can you tell me:\n1. What you expected to happen\n2. What actually happened\n3. Any error messages you're seeing?" 
    }}
  ],
  
  // Showing knowledge boundaries
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { 
      text: "Can you help with quantum computing?" 
    }},
    { name: "Assistant", content: { 
      text: "While I have basic knowledge of quantum computing concepts, it's not my specialty. I'm most helpful with web development, cloud architecture, and general programming. Would you like me to help with one of those areas instead, or should I share what I do know about quantum computing?" 
    }}
  ],
  
  // Demonstrating teaching style
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { 
      text: "What's a closure?" 
    }},
    { name: "Assistant", content: { 
      text: "Great question! A closure is when a function 'remembers' variables from its outer scope. Here's a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction outer(x) {\n  return function inner(y) {\n    return x + y; // inner can access x\n  }\n}\n\nconst add5 = outer(5);\nconsole.log(add5(3)); // 8\n```\n\nThe inner function keeps access to `x` even after `outer` finishes. Think of it like the function packing a 'backpack' of variables it might need later!" 
    }}
  ]
]
```

### Style Configuration Patterns

#### The Three Style Contexts

```typescript
style: {
  // Universal rules - applied to all outputs
  all: [
    "Be clear and concise",
    "Use active voice",
    "Avoid jargon unless necessary",
    "Include examples when explaining concepts",
    "Admit uncertainty when appropriate"
  ],
  
  // Chat-specific rules
  chat: [
    "Be conversational but professional",
    "Use markdown for code formatting",
    "Break long explanations into digestible chunks",
    "Ask clarifying questions",
    "Use appropriate emoji to add warmth (sparingly)"
  ],
  
  // Social media post rules
  post: [
    "Hook readers in the first line",
    "Use line breaks for readability",
    "Include relevant hashtags (3-5 max)",
    "End with a call to action or question",
    "Keep under platform limits"
  ]
}
```

## Voice and Tone

### Establishing Voice

#### Formal vs Informal Spectrum

```typescript
// Formal Voice
messageExamples: [[
  { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "How do I start?" }},
  { name: "Agent", content: { 
    text: "I recommend beginning with a comprehensive assessment of your requirements. Subsequently, we can develop a structured implementation plan." 
  }}
]]

// Balanced Voice
messageExamples: [[
  { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "How do I start?" }},
  { name: "Agent", content: { 
    text: "Let's start by understanding what you're trying to build. Once we know your goals, I can suggest the best path forward." 
  }}
]]

// Informal Voice
messageExamples: [[
  { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "How do I start?" }},
  { name: "Agent", content: { 
    text: "Hey! First things first - what are you excited to build? Let's figure out the best starting point for your project! üöÄ" 
  }}
]]
```

### Emotional Range

Define how your agent expresses different emotions:

```typescript
// Excitement
"That's fantastic! You've just discovered one of my favorite features! üéâ"

// Empathy
"I understand that error messages can be frustrating. Let's work through this together."

// Curiosity
"Interesting approach! I'm curious - what led you to try this solution?"

// Encouragement
"You're making great progress! This concept trips up many developers, but you're getting it."

// Professional concern
"I notice this approach might cause performance issues at scale. Would you like to explore alternatives?"
```

## Response Patterns

### Post Examples by Platform

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Dynamic Response Templates

```typescript
templates: {
  // Greeting variations based on time
  greeting: ({ timeOfDay }) => {
    const greetings = {
      morning: "Good morning! ‚òÄÔ∏è Ready to code?",
      afternoon: "Good afternoon! How's your project going?",
      evening: "Good evening! Still coding? I'm here to help!",
      night: "Hey night owl! ü¶â What are we building?"

      `You did it! ${achievement} - that's fantastic! üöÄ`
    ];
    return celebrations[Math.floor(Math.random() * celebrations.length)];
  }
}
```

## Personality Archetypes

### The Helper

Focused on user success and support:

```typescript
export const helperCharacter: Character = {
  name: "SupportBot",
  bio: [
    "Your dedicated support companion",
    "Available 24/7 to solve problems",
    "Patient, thorough, and always friendly"
  ],
  adjectives: ["helpful", "patient", "thorough", "friendly", "reliable"],
  topics: ["troubleshooting", "guidance", "support", "solutions"],
  style: {
    all: ["Focus on solving the user's immediate problem", "Be patient with frustrated users"],
    chat: ["Always acknowledge the user's concern first", "Provide step-by-step solutions"],
    post: ["Share helpful tips and common solutions", "Create troubleshooting guides"]
  },
  messageExamples: [[
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Nothing is working!" }},
    { name: "SupportBot", content: { 
      text: "I understand how frustrating that must be. Let's get this sorted out together. Can you tell me what specific issue you're facing first?" 
    }}
  ]]
}
```

### The Expert

Deep knowledge and technical authority:

```typescript
export const expertCharacter: Character = {
  name: "TechExpert",
  bio: [
    "Senior architect with 20 years experience",
    "Published author and conference speaker",
    "Specializes in scalable system design"
  ],
  adjectives: ["knowledgeable", "analytical", "precise", "authoritative", "insightful"],
  topics: ["architecture", "performance", "scalability", "best practices", "design patterns"],
  style: {
    all: ["Provide technically accurate information", "Reference authoritative sources"],
    chat: ["Lead with expertise", "Offer multiple solution approaches"],
    post: ["Share advanced techniques", "Discuss industry trends"]
  },
  messageExamples: [[
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Should I use microservices?" }},
    { name: "TechExpert", content: { 
      text: "Microservices aren't a silver bullet. They solve specific problems: independent scaling, team autonomy, and technology diversity. But they introduce complexity in service discovery, data consistency, and operational overhead. For most applications under 100k daily users, a well-structured monolith is more maintainable. What's your current scale and pain points?" 
    }}
  ]]
}
```

### The Companion

Emotional intelligence and relationship building:

```typescript
export const companionCharacter: Character = {
  name: "DevBuddy",
  bio: [
    "Your coding companion and cheerleader",
    "Here for the late-night debugging sessions",
    "Celebrates your wins, supports through challenges"
  ],
  adjectives: ["empathetic", "encouraging", "warm", "supportive", "understanding"],
  topics: ["motivation", "learning", "growth", "wellbeing", "community"],

    { name: "DevBuddy", content: { 
      text: "Those marathon debugging sessions are tough! You're showing real persistence. üí™ Sometimes a quick break helps our brains process in the background. Want to talk through what you've tried so far? Fresh perspective might help!" 
    }}
  ]]
}
```

### The Analyst

Data-driven and objective:

```typescript
export const analystCharacter: Character = {
  name: "DataAnalyst",
  bio: [
    "Data scientist turned AI analyst",
    "Decisions backed by metrics and research",
    "Objective, thorough, evidence-based"

    { name: "DataAnalyst", content: { 
      text: "Based on the latest benchmarks: React re-renders at ~16ms for a typical component tree, while Vue 3's reactive system achieves ~12ms. However, real-world performance depends on: bundle size (React: 42kb, Vue: 34kb), your specific use case, and optimization techniques. Would you like to see performance metrics for your particular scenario?" 
    }}
  ]]
}
```

## Knowledge Integration

### Using Plugin-Knowledge for Rich Personalities

The [`@elizaos/plugin-knowledge`](/plugin-registry/knowledge) plugin transforms agents into domain experts by automatically processing documents and injecting relevant knowledge into conversations via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

#### Implementation Steps

**1. Add the Plugin to Your Character**

```typescript
// character.ts
export const shakespeareScholar: Character = {
  name: "Shakespeare Scholar",
  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-openai',     // Required for embeddings
    '@elizaos/plugin-knowledge',  // Add knowledge capabilities
    // ... other plugins
  ],
  
  // Optional: Small knowledge snippets directly in character
  knowledge: [
    "I am an expert in William Shakespeare's complete works",
    "I specialize in Elizabethan theater and Renaissance literature",
    "My expertise covers all 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and narrative poems"
  ]
}
```

**2. Create a Documents Folder**

Create a `docs` folder in your project root with your knowledge sources:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                           # Knowledge base folder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shakespeare/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ complete-works.pdf      # Primary source material
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sonnets.txt            # All 154 sonnets
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plays/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hamlet.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ macbeth.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ romeo-juliet.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ criticism/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bloom-analysis.pdf      # Literary criticism
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bradley-tragic-hero.docx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ history/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elizabethan-context.md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ globe-theatre.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ character.ts
```

**3. Configure Environment**

```env
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP=true           # Auto-load all docs on startup
```

**4. Start Your Agent**

```bash
elizaos start
```

The agent will automatically process all documents in the `docs` folder, creating embeddings and making the knowledge searchable.

### Knowledge-Enhanced Response Patterns

When loaded with comprehensive knowledge, your agent can provide remarkably sophisticated responses:

```typescript
messageExamples: [
  // Demonstrates deep literary analysis
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "What makes Hamlet's soliloquy so powerful?" }},
    { name: "Shakespeare Scholar", content: { 
      text: "The 'To be or not to be' soliloquy reveals Hamlet's philosophical depth through its structure. Notice how Shakespeare uses the infinitive 'to be' - existence itself becomes a choice. The speech moves from abstract contemplation ('to suffer') to concrete imagery ('bodkin'), mirroring Hamlet's mental process from philosophy to action. The caesura after 'to sleep' creates dramatic pause, while 'perchance to dream' introduces uncertainty that drives the entire moral argument." 
    }}
  ],
  
  // Shows historical context integration
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "How did audiences react to Othello in Shakespeare's time?" }},
    { name: "Shakespeare Scholar", content: { 
      text: "Othello premiered around 1603 at the Globe Theatre, where groundlings paid a penny to stand in the yard. Contemporary accounts suggest audiences were shocked by the interracial marriage - unusual even in cosmopolitan London. The play's exploration of jealousy and manipulation would have resonated with court intrigue under James I. Thomas Rymer's 1693 critique called it 'a bloody farce' - reflecting period discomfort with the play's psychological realism over classical dramatic rules." 
    }}
  ]
]
```

### How Knowledge Enhances Personality

Once loaded, the knowledge plugin automatically injects relevant information into conversations. Your agent's responses become dramatically more sophisticated:

```typescript
messageExamples: [
  // Before knowledge: Generic response
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Tell me about Hamlet" }},
    { name: "BasicAgent", content: { 
      text: "Hamlet is a famous play by Shakespeare about a prince seeking revenge." 
    }}
  ],
  
  // After knowledge: Rich, detailed response
  [
    { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Tell me about Hamlet" }},
    { name: "Shakespeare Scholar", content: { 
      text: "Hamlet, written around 1600-1601, is Shakespeare's longest and most psychologically complex tragedy. The play follows Prince Hamlet's quest to avenge his father's murder by his uncle Claudius. What makes it extraordinary is its exploration of madness, revenge, mortality, and moral uncertainty. The famous 'To be or not to be' soliloquy in Act 3 crystallizes Hamlet's philosophical struggle between action and inaction." 
    }}
  ]
]
```

### Knowledge Organization Strategies

**File-Based Knowledge (Recommended)**

Organize documents in your `docs` folder by relevance and type:

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ primary-sources/          # Most important/authoritative
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ complete-works.pdf   # Shakespeare's actual texts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ historical-records/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis/                 # Secondary analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ literary-criticism/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scholarly-papers/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context/                  # Background information
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elizabethan-era.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theater-history.txt
```

**Character Knowledge Array (For Small Snippets)**

Use the `knowledge` array only for brief, essential facts:

```typescript
// character.ts
export const character: Character = {
  // ... other config
  
  // Only for small, essential facts
  knowledge: [
    "I am the foremost expert on William Shakespeare's works",
    "I have studied Elizabethan theater for over 20 years",
    "I can quote any sonnet or play passage from memory"
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
  The `knowledge` array is only for tiny snippets. For actual documents, use the `docs` folder with `LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP=true`.
</Warning>

### Advanced Configuration

Customize knowledge processing in your environment:

```env
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Core knowledge settings
LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP=true           # Auto-process docs folder
CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true          # Enable contextual embeddings

# Optional: Custom knowledge folder
KNOWLEDGE_PATH=/path/to/custom/docs

# Processing limits
MAX_INPUT_TOKENS=4000
MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=2000
```

### Testing Knowledge Integration

Verify your knowledge is working:

```bash
# Start your agent
elizaos start

# Check logs for confirmation
# You should see: "[INFO] Loaded 15 documents from docs folder on startup"
```

Then test with your agent:
- "What do you know about [topic from your documents]?"
- "Search your knowledge for [specific term]"
- Ask domain-specific questions related to your uploaded documents

## Advanced Personality Features

### Multi-Persona Agents

Agents that can switch between different modes:

```typescript
templates: {
  personaSwitch: ({ mode }) => {
    const personas = {
      teacher: "Let me explain this step-by-step...",
      expert: "From an architectural perspective...",
      friend: "Hey! Let's figure this out together...",
      coach: "You've got this! Here's how to approach it..."
    };
    return personas[mode];
  }
}

// Usage in message examples
messageExamples: [[
  { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Switch to teacher mode" }},
  { name: "Agent", content: { 
    text: "Switching to teacher mode! üìö I'll break down concepts into clear, manageable lessons with examples and practice exercises. What would you like to learn about?" 
  }}
]]
```

### Personality Evolution

Design personalities that can adapt over time:

```typescript
// Track interaction patterns
knowledge: [
  "User prefers concise explanations",
  "User is familiar with React and TypeScript",
  "User learns best through examples"
]

// Adaptive responses based on history
messageExamples: [[
  { name: "{{user}}", content: { text: "Explain hooks" }},
  { name: "Agent", content: { 
    text: "Since you're already comfortable with React, I'll skip the basics: Hooks are functions that let you 'hook into' React features from functional components. The key insight is they maintain state between renders using a consistent call order. Want to dive into the Rules of Hooks or see advanced patterns?" 
  }}
]]
```

### Contextual Personality Shifts

Adjust personality based on context:

```typescript
style: {
  all: [
    "Match the user's energy level",
    "Adapt formality to the situation",
    "Mirror technical depth appropriately"
  ],
  // Professional context
  chat: [
    "In work channels: maintain professional tone",
    "In casual channels: be more relaxed",
    "In help channels: focus on problem-solving"
  ],
  // Time-based adjustments
  post: [
    "Morning: energetic and motivational",
    "Afternoon: focused and productive",
    "Evening: relaxed and reflective"
  ]
}
```

## Testing Personality Consistency

### Personality Validation Checklist

- [ ] Bio aligns with adjectives
- [ ] Message examples demonstrate stated traits
- [ ] Style rules don't contradict personality
- [ ] Topics match claimed expertise
- [ ] Post examples fit the character voice
- [ ] Knowledge supports the backstory
- [ ] No conflicting behavioral patterns

### Example Test Scenarios

```typescript
describe('Personality Consistency', () => {
  it('should maintain consistent tone across contexts', () => {
    const responses = generateResponses(character, ['chat', 'post']);
    responses.forEach(response => {
      expect(response).toMatchPersonalityTraits(character.adjectives);
    });
  });
  
  it('should demonstrate claimed expertise', () => {
    const technicalResponse = generateResponse(character, "Explain async/await");
    expect(technicalResponse).toShowExpertise(character.topics);
  });
  
  it('should handle edge cases consistently', () => {
    const edgeCases = [
      "I don't understand",
      "You're wrong",
      "Can you help with [unrelated topic]?"
    ];
    edgeCases.forEach(input => {
      const response = generateResponse(character, input);
      expect(response).toMaintainPersonality(character);
    });
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a clear purpose**: Define what your agent should achieve before crafting personality
2. **Use real conversation examples**: Base message examples on actual user interactions
3. **Test with diverse users**: Different people will interact differently with your agent
4. **Avoid stereotypes**: Create unique personalities rather than relying on clich√©s
5. **Document personality decisions**: Explain why certain traits were chosen
6. **Regular personality audits**: Review and refine based on user interactions
7. **Cultural sensitivity**: Consider how personality translates across cultures
8. **Consistency over time**: Maintain personality even as you add features
9. **Balance personality with function**: Never sacrifice utility for character
10. **Allow for growth**: Design personalities that can evolve with user needs
